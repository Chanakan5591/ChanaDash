Electron dashboard app

After cloning app, from /app parent
```
npm i electron gulp -g
npm i
gulp
```
To start as Electron app, go into app folder through terminal and enter
```
electron .
```

A lot of work needs to be done still to turn this into a desktop app from a chrome extension.
A few things already look broken.
A lot of styles were made specifically for it as a Chrome extensions.
A lot of styles look wonky in the Electron app.
Geolocation needs debugging.
Focus is broken, but we're getting rid of it anyways.
It looks like the todo and settings components still work great.
